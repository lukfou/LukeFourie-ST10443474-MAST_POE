This is a working prototype of part 2 and what is needed to do on the POE. We have three pages.

Home Page:
<img width="1427" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09 01 50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f42e859-2fa8-4a6b-a760-84505fd3895c">

Add Menu Items page:
<img width="1437" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09 01 35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf70c640-b31b-48fa-bbb7-11e05c53cd94">

and a filter page, which only needs functionality implemented in final part of poe submission. 


STEPS:
1) Open Visual Studio code
2) Select File(top left) > open folder > select the folder you wish to work in. call this folder (Name Surname_Student Number_MAST Part2)
3) Once the root folder is opened, open a terminal and enter the following: 
npx create-expo-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript

4) Once prompt with a name enter the following again:
(Name Surname_Student Number_MAST Part2)

5) Once the above steps have been complete your environment is now set up. create a folder and call it screens
6) Declare the .tsx screen pages inside the screens folder (there should only be three)
7) Create the types.ts file for the RootStackParams list outside the screens folder.

Once the steps above have been complete, replace the code and declare all missing NPM installations in an INTEGRATED TERMINAL!

First:

npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

Second:

npm install @react-native-picker/picker@2.7.5
npm install react-native-safe-area-context@4.10.5
npm install react-native-screens@3.31.1
npm install typescript@~5.3.3

PART3:

Step 1) Look for changes made to part 2 project under "part3" commit message. (types.ts, and screens. (home screen and filter screen))

Step 2) problem solve the filter screen. you can make use of the buttons i have used, however better practice should make use of a picker/ drop down.

Step 3) make changes to the UI from part2, and document the changes you have made (tip- simplicity is key... small simple changes make the UI look better and more clean (dont have too much going on in the UI designs))

Step 4) Make sure you can check off the rest of rubric requirements....

Step 5) Document document document.... the more i can see the easier I can mark :)

Good luck for part3- if you follow the steps above there is no reason you cant get a distinction :)
